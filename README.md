# Data Science Tools and Applications

## Getting Started Checklist

1. Join [Piazza](#) and [Discord](#)
2. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
3. Create a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) account
4. Fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/RMGY2PpnksJ9yHEt7) with your GitHub and Kaggle account username
5. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
6. Sign up for [GradeScope](#) (code: TBD)

## About

The goal of this course is to provide students a hands-on understanding of classical data analysis techniques and to develop proficiency in applying these techniques in modern programming languages (Python) while also learning about the social and ethical challenges of collecting and mining data by studying real world examples.

The course introduces students to a wide range of techniques that are commonly used in the analysis of data such as clustering, classification, regression, and neural networks.

Note that this is not a Python (or an introduction to programming) course, so self-study will be necessary for those students who do not already know the language.

### Prerequisites

Students taking this class must have some prior familiarity with programming at the level of CS 105, 108, or 111, or equivalent. CS 132 or equivalent (MA 242, MA 442) is required. CS 112 is also helpful.

## Emails

If emailing the CS506 staff, or creating a private Piazza post, please always CC or include the instructor, the CF, and all TAs.

## Final Project

BU Spark! offers students an opportunity to work on technical projects provided by companies or organizations in the Greater Boston area through our experiential learning lab (X-Lab). For this semester, Spark! has partnered with CS506 to offer a diverse selection of external data science projects scoped to support the course’s learning outcomes and enhance the student experience. To learn more about Spark!, please visit their [website](https://www.bu.edu/spark/).

Spark! projects are a great opportunity for students to get real-world project experience to highlight on their github and CV. These projects have already been curated and will be presented during “Pitch Day”. Project descriptions will be made available at the start of the semester. BU Spark! projects will be led by one of the Spark! Project managers. Each project will be assigned a Spark! Technical Engineer to review PRs, review code, and provide technical support.

Teams will have 3-5 students. Students that decide to take on the role of team lead will receive extra credit. Teams will be formed based on availability and a project preference form that you will be asked to submit after Pitch Day.

Please read [the following guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cg8O-tY58vciQ_TYi1MpPFZ730fU_YyTs6GBZ0SMAj4) for details regarding roles and responsibilities as well as best practices for navigating BU Spark! projects.

Expectations of Spark! project deliverables are outlined [here](https://gallettilance.github.io/deliverables/).

## Homeworks

The homework assignments will be due throughout the semester as relevant material is covered. There will be 7 assignments in total. Homeworks are collaborative. You can submit them individually or as a group. I highly encourage you to create a study group, share knowledge, and work on and submit the homeworks together.

### Late Policy

Late homeworks will be accepted up to 48h after the due date. Late homeworks will incur a 12% penalty for the first 24h and a 20% penalty for next 24h. No points will be awarded after 48h. The lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.

### Re-Grades

If you notice an issue with a grade you’ve received, please don't email the teaching staff. Instead, please submit a regrade on Gradescope within 48h of receiving the grade. Anything beyond 48h will not be accepted for a re-grade.

## Midterm

The midterm will be a Kaggle Data Science competition among the students in the class with a live leaderboard. Students will need to submit predictions based on a training dataset and a report detailing the methods used and decisions made.

## Worksheets

Every lecture is accompanied with a worksheet due 24h after lecture. To receive credit, you need to reasonably complete them reasonably well. There will be no partial credit for worksheets or late deadlines. These are meant to help you further develop practical skills learned in class.
