# Final Project Requirements

Your final project must be in a github repo with:
1. A REAME.md detailing the project, how to build and use the code, how to contribute, how to test the code, and what environment it’s supported in.
2. Github workflow should be defined to test the code. Just test a few things you think are important - no need to overdo it on the testing front that’s not the focus of the project.
3. Code should be consumable / runnable and results should be reproduceable with only a few instructions / commands

More details to follow.
